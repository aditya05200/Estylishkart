            <strong>Return, Exchange, Cancellation and Refund Policy</strong><strong> </strong><br/>

EstylishKart's returns and exchange policy gives you an option to return or exchange items purchased on EstylishKart for reason within the specified return/exchange period (check product details page for the same) and within one week if not mentioned on product. Feel free to try on a product but all we ask is that the product remains unused and is preserved in its original condition along with the tags and packaging. In case a Seal Tag is received with the item, ensure that it remains attached &amp; intact with the product to avoid any hassles in the event of a return/exchange. In the event of broken seal and tags, EstylishKart will not accept any cancellation of return and/or exchange of product. There are two ways to return the product to us:
<br/>
<ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
 	<li>Pick up: In most locations, we offer a free pick up service. You will see a pickup option when you submit a return request.</li>
 	<li>Self-Ship: If we don't offer a pick up at your location. In such cases, we will credit the shipping costs in the form of EstylishKart credits provided the product meets the return policy and you have shared scan copy of the courier receipt with us.</li>
</ol>
<br />
During Pick Up, our delivery agent may do a quality check on the return. For a successful pick up, we will initiate a doorstep refund for the return amount into the refund mode selected at the time of initiating the return request. This doorstep refund may not be applicable for some pin codes in which case refund will be initiated after the product has been received at our warehouse and has passed a quality check. If the picked up product does not pass the quality check, we shall ship it back to you. If you choose to exchange the item for reason of mismatch of size or receipt of a defective item, you will be provided with a replacement of the item, free of cost. However all exchanges are subject to stock availability and subject to your address being serviceable for an exchange. If you choose to exchange an item, our delivery representative will deliver the new item to you and simultaneously pick up the original item from you.
